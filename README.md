Designed and developed a custom carrier board to interface the Imperix BBoard PRO with a Siemens 16kW S120 Converter. This project involved significant modifications to the original Imperix design to accommodate specific needs, such as an expanded board size to include additional RJ-45 connectors, and the integration of a +5V power supply circuit to support the Siemens S120's digital circuit.

Key contributions include:

- Power Supply Enhancements: Added an additional +5V power supply circuit and integrated existing 3V3 and Â±15V supplies to support external components and sensors.
- ADC Circuit Adjustments: Implemented filtering and signal transformation for analog inputs, enabling plug-and-play functionality with Imperix sensors.
- Interface Modifications: Redesigned the JX2 connector interface to accommodate Siemens' PWM and delta sigma measurements, including logic inversion for IGBT control.
- Mechanical Integration: Adapted the board's mounting design for seamless integration with the Siemens S120 inverter.
